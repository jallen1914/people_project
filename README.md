# People Project

Use Python, MySQL, and a web framework to create a web app
that allows a user to enter the following:

name, city, state, and phone number

- Entered user data should be stored in the database
- There should be a front-end component for viewing names in the database

### Objectives
- Create database
- Create simple form
- Create app with front and backend
- Minimal UI styling
- Query the database through front end
- Create export tab for generating a CSV from the database

### Files
people_default.csv - Staging file with the default values to be imported into the database
requirements.txt - Pip requirement file for Flask
people.py - Main source file with all the base code
base.html - Base template that will be applied to all other templates. Includes styling
index.html - Main page the contains the HTML with the form to input people into the database
show_people.html - Page that lists all of the names from the database

### Databases
The people.db database is the main database for the project and contains one table called people_default

### Archive
Along the way as direction changes, old files are sent here to move them out of the way.
They can be easily restored and put back in place
